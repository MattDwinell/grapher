# Grapher #
Grapher is a clientside application that does your preliminary data analysis for you!
Simply upload a csv file and it will find out which fields are quantitative and which are qualitative.
It then generates histograms for each quantitative field based on Sturge's formula, and also implements Scott's normal reference rule.
Future iterations of grapher will include association scatterplots for quantitative variables, as well as 
bar charts grouping counts of qualitative variables.
